							Outside of programming I enjoy playing video games, primarily action/adventure. I have a lot of love for Ubisoft&apos;s
							Assassin&apos;s Creed series. I also love consuming audiobooks and my favourite author is Brandon Sanderson. I absolutely
							adore his Cosmere universe. I also enjoy reading the Harry Potter franchise and I tend to re-listen to the series every
							few years. Overall I have a huge weak spot for most anything fantasy. From time to time I also play Dungeons & Dragons
							with my friends where I use my love for fantasy to go on epic table top adventures.
