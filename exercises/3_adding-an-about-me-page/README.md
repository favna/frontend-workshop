# Exercise 3

In this exercise we will write an about page in a React application.

The challenge here is to find your way around the React code and write something about yourself that looks nice and is
interesting to read.

## Requirements

The application should have the following requirements:

-   The about me should tell us something about yourself

## Hints

1. You can start this application by navigating to the this folder in your terminal then running the command:

    ```bash
    npm install && npm run dev
    ```

However, if you face issues doing this you can follow this URL to do it online:

## Advanced assignment

If you're already done with the assignment and we have not yet continued the workshop to the next topic here is an
advanced assignment that you can pick up.

As you will have noticed the web application has a "home" page and an "about" page. For the advanced assignment we want
you to add another page, called "review". On this page you will write a short review about your experience with the
graduate class so far and what you hope to learn in the coming weeks.

-   Start by adding a link to the review page to the right of the button for the about page.
-   Add the review page and make sure you can navigate to it
-   Write a review about your experience with the graduate class so far and what you hope to learn in the coming weeks
